    "Pgm3: Write a Python program that simulates a simple text-based adventure game called “Treasure Island.”  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The program should:  \n",
    "\t1.\tDisplay a welcome message and explain the mission.  \n",
    "\t2.\tAsk the user to choose a direction at a crossroad (left or right).  \n",
    "\t3.\tBased on the user’s choice, present further decisions using conditional statements.   \n",
    "\t4.\tConvert all user input to lowercase to handle case-insensitive input.  \n",
    "\t5.\tEnd the game with either “You Win!” or “Game Over.” depending on the choices made.  \n",
