BASIC STATISTICS

Descriptive Analytics and Data Preprocessing on Sales & Discounts Dataset

Introduction:

● To perform descriptive analytics, visualize data distributions, and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.

Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns:

● Objective: To compute and analyze basic statistical measures for numerical columns in the dataset.

● Steps:

- Load the dataset into a data analysis tool or programming environment (e.g., Python with pandas library).
- Identify numerical columns in the dataset.
- Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for these columns.
- Provide a brief interpretation of these statistics.

Data Visualization:

● Objective: To visualize the distribution and relationship of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.

● Histograms:

- Plot histograms for each numerical column.
- Analyze the distribution (e.g., skewness, presence of outliers) and provide inferences.

● Boxplots:

- Create boxplots for numerical variables to identify outliers and the interquartile range.
- Discuss any findings, such as extreme values or unusual distributions.

● Bar Chart Analysis for Categorical Column:

- Identify categorical columns in the dataset.
- Create bar charts to visualize the frequency or count of each category.
- Analyze the distribution of categories and provide insights.

Standardization of Numerical Variables:

● Objective: To scale numerical variables for uniformity, improving the dataset’s suitability for analytical models.

● Steps:

- Explain the concept of standardization (z-score normalization).
- Standardize the numerical columns using the formula: z=x-mu/sigma

Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables:

● Objective: To transform categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML algorithms.

● Steps:

- Discuss the need for converting categorical data into dummy variables (one-hot encoding).
- Apply one-hot encoding to the categorical columns, creating binary (0 or 1) columns for each category.
- Display a portion of the transformed dataset.

Conclusion:

● Summarize the key findings from the descriptive analytics and data visualizations.
● Reflect on the importance of data preprocessing steps like standardization and one-hot encoding in data analysis and machine learning.
